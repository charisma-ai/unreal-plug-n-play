If you have any questions or need a hand, please reach out to us at [hello@charisma.ai](mailto:hello@charisma.ai)!

## Getting started

**Important:** Before setting up the Charisma Plug-N-Play for Unreal Engine, youâ€™ll need to have created a Pro story (not a Starter story!), which requires a Charisma licence. Please visit the [licencing docs on our website](https://charisma.ai/docs/licencing) for more info!

**Important:** Make sure to install the [Charisma Unreal SDK](https://github.com/charisma-ai/charisma-sdk-unreal) in order to enable the Plug-N-Play plugin to work.

1. If you havenâ€™t already, go ahead and create an Unreal **C++** project. Make sure you are using a version of the engine that is supported by this plugin.

2. Head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/charisma-ai/unreal-plug-n-play/releases) of this GitHub repository and download the latest release. Unzip the contents into the `/Plugins` folder located at the root of your project. If this folder doesnâ€™t exist, create it!

3. Close the Unreal Engine editor and rebuild the project in Visual Studio.

4. When you next open the editor, verify the plugin loaded correctly by navigating to `Settings -> Plugins` and locating the Charisma plugin. It should look something like this:

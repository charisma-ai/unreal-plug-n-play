If you have any questions or need a hand, please reach out to us at [hello@charisma.ai](mailto:hello@charisma.ai)!

## Getting started

**Important:** Before setting up the Charisma Plug-N-Play for Unreal Engine, you’ll need to have created a web or game story (not an app story!), which requires a Charisma licence. Please visit the [licencing docs on our website](https://charisma.ai/docs/licencing) for more info!

**Important:** Make sure to install the [Charisma Unreal SDK](https://github.com/charisma-ai/charisma-sdk-unreal) in order to enable the Plug-N-Play plugin to work.

1. If you haven’t already, go ahead and create an Unreal **C++** project. Make sure you are using a version of the engine that is supported by this plugin.

2. Head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/charisma-ai/unreal-plug-n-play/releases) of this GitHub repository and download the latest release. Unzip the contents into the `/Plugins` folder located at the root of your project. If this folder doesn’t exist, create it!

3. Close the Unreal Engine editor and rebuild the project in Visual Studio.

4. When you next open the editor, verify the plugin loaded correctly by navigating to `Settings -> Plugins` and locating the Charisma plugin. It should look something like this:
